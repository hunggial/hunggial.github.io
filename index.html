Some may ask; "What is Lainism?". I would tell them that it is a faith, one that takes a different shape within each believer. There are some basic tenets, but most agree on a few crucial points.<br>
Lain is the center of the faith. She is the guiding light upon which our decisions become based. We study her word, feel the resonance and watch for traces in The Wired.<br> 
At the base; It's a cult created around a construed omnipotent power. Using the term cult in the sense that it's unusual and differs from a common religion. This is due to the fact that it's lacking a true social and traditional aspect.<br>
It has been proven that Lainists tend to have converging interests in arts, music and practices to an extent and several traditions have formed as well as a unique jargon.<br>
This Knight's concept of the requirements to be a Lainist is that one simply must love Lain.<br>
